		room at The Village Library. The room is bright, colorful, and arranged with children in mind.
		There are a few steps or sitting rows in front of a beautiful window. Two sets of tables and
		chairs provide a place to sit and read or to work on a project during the Story Hour at 10:30 on
		Tuesday mornings. There are some stuffed toys for cuddling and even a small rocking chair to
		relax.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ojto4e">If you are looking for a book…keep color in mind as the materials are arranged by color
		for specific age groups. The spines of all the fiction books have a bright colorful dot. As you
		enter the children’s room, the RED dots on the books to the right are for pre-school and
		up. These books are great for tiny tots to beginning readers. You might also want to look at
		these red-dotted books for their beautiful art work. Award winners are labeled at the top of the
		spine with a “Caldecott Award” sticker. Continuing toward the back of the room, you
		will find a few shelves with GREEN dots. These books are especially set aside for those children
		who are just beginning to read. The vocabulary is controlled, the print is large, and the
		stories are fun. Look at the green-dotted books to get kids going on reading.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-sz8w5e">The BLUE books are for elementary school age…approximately grades 2 through 5. Many
		favorite authors are here from Cleary and Keene to Parks and Wilder, there are stories old and
		new. Middle school books are labeled in YELLOW. Look for Newbery Award winners, both in the
		yellow and blue, to find that special book. Then there are the favorites… Harry Potter,
		Lemony Snickett, and anything by O’Dell or Tolkien.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bpd6au">To complete the collection, be sure to look at the non-fiction books. These books do not have
		color dots on them, but are shelved according to the Dewey Decimal System, just as they are in
		the regular section in the library. Have you looked at books in the 398.2’s? These are
		fairy tales and will surely delight most any age. Don’t forget the 800’s for poetry
		and the 560’s for dinosaurs!</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1xsfh2a">Now that you have had a quick tour of our children’s room “on paper”, stroll
		on into the room on your next visit to The Village Library. You maybe surprised at what you
		find!</p> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-bankb4"><figcaption>Ocean Creatures--2019 Children&#39;s Summer Reading Program.</figcaption> <img alt="2019 Children's Summer Program 1"${add_attribute("src", _2019Childrens1, 0)} class="picture"> <br> <img alt="2019 Children's Summer Program 2"${add_attribute("src", _2019Childrens2, 0)} class="picture"></figure> <br> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1yilhu3"><figcaption>Not-So-Scary Halloween 2018.</figcaption> <img alt="Not-So-Scary Halloween Story Time"${add_attribute("src", NotSoScaryHalloween, 0)} class="picture"></figure> <br> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1kx3fdq"><figcaption>Turtle Time Tuesdays--2018 Children&#39;s Summer Reading Program.</figcaption> <img alt="2018 Children's Summer Program 1"${add_attribute("src", _2018Childrens01, 0)} class="picture"> <br> <img alt="2018 Children's Summer Program 2"${add_attribute("src", _2018Childrens02, 0)} class="picture"> <br> <img alt="2018 Children's Summer Program 3"${add_attribute("src", _2018Childrens03, 0)} class="picture"> <br> <img alt="2018 Children's Summer Program 4"${add_attribute("src", _2018Childrens04, 0)} class="picture"> <br> <img alt="2018 Children's Summer Program 5"${add_attribute("src", _2018Childrens05, 0)} class="picture"></figure> <br> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-hoemok"><figcaption>Bee A Reader--2017 Children&#39;s Summer Reading Program.</figcaption> <img alt="BeeAReader 1"${add_attribute("src", BeeAReader1, 0)} class="picture"> <br> <img alt="BeeAReader 2"${add_attribute("src", BeeAReader2, 0)} class="picture"></figure> <br> <figure data-svelte-h="svelte-kkyh0h"><figcaption>Phyllis Tildes donates two of her beautiful paintings to the Children&#39;s Room.
