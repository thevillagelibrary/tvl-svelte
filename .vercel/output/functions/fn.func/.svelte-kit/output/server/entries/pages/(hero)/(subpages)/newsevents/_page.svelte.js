		PRESIDENT&#39;S REPORT
		<br>
		2022-23</h2> <br> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nvauzw"><b>CHALLENGES &amp; THE MIRACLE</b></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1fsrbdc">The past year began with the annual Board retreat—when we reviewed our accomplishments of the
		prior year and set the priorities for the upcoming year. Then we encountered a few speed bumps
		as we began our journey through the year with the departure of people who had occupied critical
		positions: Phil Van Ess departed as Facilities Manager in March of 2022; Training Coordinator
		Liz McAdams moved away in November 2022; Treasurer Carol Holland stepped down in early 2023;
		Book Sale Coordinator Kim Hicks moved away after the Fall 2022 book sale;, Youth Services
		Coordinator Kathy Kahn resigned her Board position in Spring 2023; and IT Consultant Jacob
		Dimond passed away in December 2022. The result was that we spent much of our time and energy
		this past year filling vacancies and training new people.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-joacqq"><b>The miracle?</b> The Village Library&#39;s Board and volunteers keep the place running through
		thick and thin. The Village Library exists because of the extraordinary effort of over 75 dedicated
		volunteers who devote their time and talents daily. The success of this venture for thirty years
		is the result of dedication and effort of many people who carry on in spite of the speed bumps.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15k1oso"><b>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</b></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-r2urhy">There are accomplishments to highlight this year:</p> <section class="svelte-qbq1zr" data-svelte-h="svelte-2c50hq"><p class="svelte-qbq1zr">The Board was successful in its application for a Landlovers&#39; grant of $2,100 to fund
			children&#39;s books and programs and a new printer in 2023.</p> <p class="svelte-qbq1zr">Under the leadership of Terry Kessler, the Library successfully implemented the Finance
			Committee&#39;s 2021 recommendation for investing the Library’s reserves through a Fidelity
			brokerage account.</p> <p class="svelte-qbq1zr">Cece Coleman led Collection Development efforts to create a single, coordinated approach to
			the special collections—introducing the Browsing Collection with designation of each
			collection in the catalog. Just Off Rental, New, Local Authors, and Recommended books joined
			the Rental books with icons in the online catalog; and the position of Browsing Collection
			Coordinator was created to manage the collections. The result is that books in the collection
			are now easy to find, helping volunteers and patrons in their searches.</p> <p class="svelte-qbq1zr">Vice President for Community Relations Brenda Day continued to lead the Library&#39;s efforts
			to expand the Spring and Fall book sales to achieve our goal of having a festival of community
			activities to supplement the library&#39;s sidewalk sale. The Landings Art Association, the
			Landings Garden Club, various PEO chapters, and individual artists and authors all came
			together with the library to feature their work and sell their wares. Brenda also recruited
			and supported the new Book Sale Coordinator, Lynn Townsend, who successfully organized the
			Spring 2023 sale.</p> <p class="svelte-qbq1zr">Public Information Officer (PIO) Nicole Tifverman set a new, high standard for that
			position—continuing her excellent work publicizing and communicating about the Library through
			social media, work with various publications, delightful fliers and img_pictures, and the
			excellent monthly volunteer newsletter. She is leaving her position as PIO but will continue
			as an at-large member of the Board and the new Browsing Collection Coordinator.</p></section> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ivga19">I want to highlight the contributions of Vice-President of Operations Renée Collins as
		she departs the Board after three years. Renee’s creativity and hard work have led to new
		procedures, improved customer service, and a better Library. She will be missed.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ndxb12">There are many other accomplishments to celebrate this year. These are just a few examples of
		the contributions from the Board and volunteers this year. Once again this year, I want to
		emphasize that no President succeeds without the work of many, many people—I appreciate each and
		every one of you.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ql7k2z">Sandy Cooper, President</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1hw876w">2022-2023</p>`;
